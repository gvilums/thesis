Could look at Swaptions and BlackScholes for reference, but these are not really interesting applications because their parallel structure is very simple

Instead, might look at subset of PrIM applications:
- Select
- Histogram
- Reduction

Can introduce variations of these benchmarks, too. For example
- In Histogram, vary the histogram granularity, and look at tradeoffs for number of reduction variables vs. WRAM usage
- In Select, vary the selectivity of the predicate e.g. low/medium/large fraction of elements selected and returned, and compare efficiency of the two different filtering approaches

What other interesting applications are there?
