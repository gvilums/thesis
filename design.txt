# Main Design Points

- multiple input arrays? yes (but have to have same size)
- multiple outputs? no (possible, but probably unnecessary)
- primitive operations: filter, map, reduce. probably nothing else
- data types: all primitives. what about custom types/structs? probably want that, to enable dealing with diff. types elems. However, not strictly needed
